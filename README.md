# Choco-Master-Launcher

Choco-Master-launcher is an executable I made to be able to play master levels without the need for annoying parameters, as well as being able to play iwads without having to go into chocolate-doom.setup to choose a default wad. (update of my previous project). The original purpose of this idea was to have a Master Levels menu for Chocolate Doom, because in Chocolate Doom there is no such thing as Doom-it to load them easily, but I also added the option to choose Iwads to give a little more content to the launcher.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1: You need the folder that contains the master levels wads, the name of that folder is wads, but if it has another name, then rename it to wads.

2: Put the "wads" folder in the same directory where you have chocolate-doom.exe and doom2.wad.

3: Put Choco-Master-launcher in the same directory where you have chocolate-doom.exe and doom2.wad.

4: Double-click Choco-Master-launcher.exe, choose skill level and choose a wad.

Extra additions:

1: You can play the Master Levels with Peter Lawrence's Master Levels MIDI Pack. (Thanks to Peter for letting me use the MIDI pack to add musical variety to the menu.)

2: You can also play any iwad you want, just put Doom, Doom II, TNT and Plutonia in the same directory where you have chocolate-doom.exe, that way, you won't need to have the iwads in different folders and if you have plutmidi.wad, the menu will  detect it automatically.

7: As a bonus you can play some selected mods like Icarus Aliend Vanguard, Hell Revealed, Back to Saturn X, Aliend Vendetta, Doom II Reloaded, Revolution, Requien, 50 Monsters, Akeldama and Anomaly Report,  all you have to do is download that wads and put them in a new folder., rename the folder as "mods" and move it to the directory where you have chocolate-doom.exe and DOOM2.WAD.
